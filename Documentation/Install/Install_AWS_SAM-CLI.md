# Installing AWS SAM-CLI

The installation of AWS SAM-CLI is actually pretty straightforward and available in mulitple languages on their website, via this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

The only thing you may need to be careful is that you may need git installed if it is not already.

As for the version, as of writing, the SAM API gateway works with the latest version of the Command Line Interface, so I would suggest you take the latest.

In the event in the future that it does not work anymore with the latest version, I would rather advise you to change the source code rather than changing CLI version, as in production you will most likely use the latest version.
